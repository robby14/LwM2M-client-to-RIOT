# LwM2M-client-to-RIOT
L2M2M client (based on wakaama project) imported to RIOT

The goal of this project is to import wakaama client to RIOT.
At the moment it works just in "native" that is on Linux (see the makefile), but the final goal is to make it work also and overall for the boards (like UDOO and others).

Any help is appreciated.
